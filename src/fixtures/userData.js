  introduction: ["I am former Researcher made Software Engineer. While my focus throughout my academic years has been in research, I always had a passion for developing software solutions to meet/ease our projects. This has led me, to leave the academic environment and completely embrace the software world I had so much interest in. Throughout this time, I have been continuously improving my skills in web development (JavaScript, HTML5/XML as well as in JAVA), and gaining experience in this fast-paced industry. Some of my best qualities are the tenacity to never give up and to be always eager to learn more. Together with my continuous search for improvement and academic background I am searching for defying challenges that can make me thrive as well"],
